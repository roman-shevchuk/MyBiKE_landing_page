The MyBiKE project is a landing page for a bike store, created using HTML5 and SCSS.

HTML
	•	Used semantic tags (header, section, article, footer) for better structure and SEO.
	•	Followed the principle of dividing content into blocks, which makes it easier to adapt and maintain.
	•	Added images and icons using img and svg.
	•	Used forms and buttons for user interaction.
	•	Followed the BEM methodology for class naming, making the code clear and modular.

CSS (SCSS)
	•	Structured using BEM, ensuring clean and reusable styles.
	•	Used variables for colors, fonts, and spacing, making theme editing easier.
	•	Mixins are used to simplify the reuse of styles for buttons and animations.
	•	Added responsive design with @media for proper display on different devices.
	•	Flexbox and Grid are used for layout arrangement.
